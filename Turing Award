Turing Award

The A.M. Turing Award, sometimes referred to as the "Nobel Prize of Computing," was named in honor of Alan Mathison Turing (1912â€“1954), 
a British mathematician and computer scientist. He made fundamental advances in computer architecture, algorithms, formalization of 
computing, and artificial intelligence. Turing was also instrumental in British code-breaking work during World War II.
